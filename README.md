## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js` for the front end view. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/chat](http://localhost:3000/api/chat). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/chat.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
Add OpenAI API key to .env file.

##NOTE
Please note that testing the app deployed on vercel charges the owner of the app. But should be fine as the balance is set to 5$ at the moment.

## Deploy on Vercel

The app has been deployed on vercel.
